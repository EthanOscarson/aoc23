This is my Advent of Code for 2023!

I'll use a random wheel to choose my language for each day, from Rust, Go, Javascript, C, Typescript, and Java. You can use it from langs.wheel on wheelofnames.com

Day 1: Javascript
- Part 1 Completed! 12/1 First try compile!
- Part 2 Completed! 12/2 Had to think about and watch Low Level Learning's solution to get this one.
